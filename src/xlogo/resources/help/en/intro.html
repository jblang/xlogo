    <h1>Introduction to XLogo</h1>

    <p><strong>Logo</strong> is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Seymour Papert.
    Papert developed an influential theory on learning called "constructionism" which could be
    summarized as "learning by doing."</p>

    <p>Logo is an excellent language for developing mathematical and logic skills. It teaches
    the basics of programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and procedures. Users control
    an object called a <strong>turtle</strong> that moves around the screen using simple commands
    like <code>forward</code>, <code>back</code>, <code>right</code>, and <code>left</code>.
    As it moves, the turtle leaves a trail, allowing you to create drawings.</p>

    <h2>What is XLogo?</h2>

    <p><strong>XLogo</strong> is a Logo interpreter - your instructions are executed immediately,
    and you can see the results on screen right away. This intuitive graphical approach makes
    Logo ideal for beginners, especially children!</p>
