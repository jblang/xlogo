# XLogo Examples

This folder contains XLogo examples in several languages. 

- The [English](en) examples mostly came from Guy Walker's [Logo Arts](http://www.cr31.co.uk/logoarts/index.html) website.  The 3D and games directories were translated from the French examples.
- The [French](fr) and [Spanish](es) examples from the [XLogo Website](https://xlogo.tuxfamily.org/) are mostly translations of Guy Walker's English examples, but the 3D and Games examples are unique. 
- The [Portuguese](pt) examples from the XLogo Website are unique, not translations of the English examples.
