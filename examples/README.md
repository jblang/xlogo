# XLogo Examples

This folder contains XLogo examples in several languages. 

- The [English](en) examples mostly came from Guy Walker's [Logo Arts](http://www.cr31.co.uk/logoarts/index.html) website.
- The [French](fr) and [Spanish](es) examples from the [XLogo Website](https://xlogo.tuxfamily.org/) are mostly translations of Guy Walker's English examples. However, there are some unique examples, especially for 3D and games. 
- The [Portuguese](pt) examples from the XLogo Website are unique, not translations of the English examples.
