This directory contains sources for the XLogo documentation. The [README](../README.md) in the root directory has
links to formatted documentation on the XLogo website.

Note: commands used to generate the output from these sources are undocumented and untested.  Sources for all the 
docs are not available.  The German does are written using [Txt2tags](https://txt2tags.org/) instead of TeX.
