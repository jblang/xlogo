# Dot Plots
![Dot Plots](../../art/400x400/henon.png)

| These images are generated by plotting a (usually large) number 
of discreet dots. No lines are drawn between dots. Some of the images are created from mathematical equations, and 
can take a while to complete. If a mapping function is used then they are 
called 'Iterative Function Systems' (IFS). In XLogo, the dot command plots a single pixel in the pen color 
at the specified XY co-ordinates. The turtle does not move to the 
new position to draw the dot. See also:DotsFill screen with random dots.
