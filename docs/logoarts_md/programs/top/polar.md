# Polar Curves
![Polar Curves](../../art/400x400/flora.png)

| All these curves are generated using equations in polar (Radius 
and Theta) form. Usually, we plot points using X Y co-ordinates, (orRectangularnotation). A pair of numbers, define the horizontal and vertical 
distance from the origin. In XLogo, the commandSetXYmoves 
the turtle to any XY point on the screen. Alternatively, we can use polar co-ordinates. These again use a 
pair of numbers. The first (called Radius) gives the distance from 
the origin. The second (called Theta) gives the angle or bearing 
(measured from North). Again, we can move the turtle to any point on the screen.Note that using polar notation, points can be expressed in more 
than one way. We can turn in a positive or negative direction. Also 
the Radius can be positive (forward) or negative (back). Sometimes, they are then converted into X Y co-ordinates for drawing 
by the turtle using theSetXYcommand by the procedureP2R(polar to rectangular). It requires two varibles, Radius and Theta 
and outputs the X and Y co-ordinates as a list. | Butterfly CurveThe butterfly curve.FloraScattering of colored flower petals.Rose CurvesVarious rose curves.SpiralsArchimedies, Fermat and logarithmic spirals.SunflowerEntwined logarithmic spirals of a sunflower head.Twisted Rose CurveVarious twisted rose curves.Twisted R C AnimA series of 20 twisted curves. |
