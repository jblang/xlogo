| These trees are grown using recursive techniques. Each branch splits 
into two smaller branches, until the branch length is too small to continue. By varying the branch lengths and angles, more natural looking trees 
are made. See also: Antenna TreeAntenna Tree curve. Binary SwitchA divide by two selector switch.
