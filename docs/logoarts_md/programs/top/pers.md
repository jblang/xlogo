# View 3D

| These programs use perspective mode to allow the turtle to move in 
3D space. This adds a depthZvalue to the normal 2DXandYvalues. Building shapes in 3D is not as easy as 2D. The turtle can roll and pitch, so there are often several different ways of drawing a given shape. A 2D square has 4 edges and 4 corners. In 3D a cube has 6 faces, 8 corners and 12 edges. EnteringView 3Ddisplays the lines, points and surfaces in fully rotateable 3D. Lights and fog can be added. Note: Type in the commandCS View3Dto clear the View3D window and prevent too many shapes building up.

One Liners

You need to be in Perspective mode (type in 3D).

Copy and paste any **one** line of code into the 
XLogo command line and press <Enter> key to run. Widen the 
XLogo window to easily see and edit a long instruction.

You may need to first type in **CS** to clear the 
screen. You can change the default pen and screen color by selecting 
Tools / Preferences / Options from the XLogo menu.

To slow down the drawing speed add in your own **Wait** commands.

Try and work out the image each code will produce before you 
run it...

```logo
