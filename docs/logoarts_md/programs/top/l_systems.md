| L-Systems were invented in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer to model biological growth. They provide a flexible method for drawing many curves and 
fractals. They start with anaxiomlist, and then use a set of production rules to 
modify the elements in this list. This process of string 
substitutions is then repeated at each iteration. It can create very long lists. A second procedure thenrendersthe list, by translating each element into a turtle command which draws the final curve.
