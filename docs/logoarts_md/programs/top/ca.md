| In any cellular automata (CA) program, the screen is divided up 
into a number of square cells. The color of each cell represents its state. At the start, all 
cells are black (state 0). The turtle starts in one cell. To determine what to do next, the 
turtle finds the color (state) of its current and neighbouring cells. This information tells the turtle which cells to recolor (alter 
the state of) and which neighbouring cell to move to next. The result is a pattern of different colored cells. | Langton's AntSimple 2D Turing machine.SingleLine CALine by line. |
