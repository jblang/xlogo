| To create animations, XLogo must first be put into animation mode by 
the commandAnimation. Drawing no longer updates the screen but instead changes are stored. TheRefreshcommand updates the graphics screen, as the next 'frame' in the animation. Usually 
done once per main loop of the program. All the stored changes appear 
immediately. A camera icon in the Text Area will remind you animation is on. To return to normal drawing mode, enterStopAnimation, or click the camera icon. See Animationprimitives.
